# MineFinder

Its a Logical Board-based Puzzle Game.

The Enemies have Put Some Mines all over the Place. 
Now its up to Us, to Find All the Mines, and Put Signboards there, so No one might Step on it. 

So we Put Sensors on some Locations, which Tell us about the Number of Mines in its Range. 
The Range is only One Neighboring Place on All Sides. 

We can Get Help from these Numbers to Actually Find the Mines. 
This is All we've Got. Some Help is Better than No Help. 

After Evacuating the Places where there are Mines, we can Safely Detonate them All. 
Otherwise, there will be a lot of Casualities. 


### How to Play:

   1. Enter the **Index** (Row and Coloumn, seperated by Space) on the given Board to Select the Box. 
   
   2. If there's a Mine in there, then Input Yes to Put the Mine Signboard.
      If there's no Mine in there, then Input No to Declare it a Safezone.
     
   3. You can Detonate the Place anytime by Entering -8-8 as an Input. 
      If you had Correclty Marked the Mines, You Win. Otherwise Lose.
